                    <h2>Hard Money Definition</h2>
                    <p>Hard money loans are all done privately, outside of conventional banking establishments.
                        Typically, this is done by private individuals to the loan seeker.</p>
                    <p>The average loan term for hard money loans is 12 months as opposed to 30 years for a typical home loan through a traditional lending institution. While there are dozens of hoops to jump through for a typical loan,
                        hard money loans are quicker and require fewer steps to complete.</p>
                    <p>Often these types of loans are sought out when an investment might not be approved by a traditional institution. Hard money lending secures the loan by looking at the property and its value, the investor’s credit score, and any collateral
                        you put up. The amount of the overall loan is determined by these factors.</p>

                    <h2>Who does hard money lending?</h2>
                    <p>There are several large private lending firms that do hard money loans across the
                        country. Here at Global Integrity Finance, we’re funding hard money loans everyday.</p>
                    <p>In addition to nationwide companies, local private lending institutions may offer hard money loans
                        for your next project that connect you with lenders in the community.</p>
                    <p>There are several things to consider when choosing a hard money lender and questions you
                        can ask to determine if their services are right for you.</p>

                    <h5>Are you the actual lender or just a broker?</h5>
                    <p>Lots of hard money and investment firms work as brokers between lenders and investors. Making sure you know who is lending you the money and who is just handling the deal
                        can help you determine how much or how little your lender will be involved.</p>

                    <h5>What project details or documents are needed for a quote?</h5>
                    <p>Because the value of the loan is determined by the value of the property and the subsequent renovations, the lending institution will need to see some plans and projections to determine the size of the loan. Be prepared
                        to bring the needed paperwork to get a quote from the hard money lenders.</p>

                    <h5>How do you handle interest?</h5>
                    <p>When looking at a loan, you always need to factor in interest. Some institutions charge interest monthly or at the end of the loan so asking what the hard money lenders are planning to charge
                        and when they expect it to be due, is crucial to planning for your finances.</p>

            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>Finding financing for your first home or your next investment project can seem daunting. Hard money loans bridge the gap between out-of-pocket spending and traditional
                home loans by offering short-term loans with fewer restrictions and requirements.</p>
            <p>While the loans have fewer restrictions and requirements they have a much shorter period to be paid back and costs can be steeper. Hard money lenders can be found in nationwide companies or smaller lending establishments in your
                community but be sure to ask pointed questions so you’ll be prepared.</p>
